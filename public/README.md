## Logo

Place your PeerCV logo image file here as `logo.png`.

The logo should be:
- PNG format (or SVG)
- Transparent background
- High resolution (at least 512x512px recommended)
- Named exactly `logo.png`

The app will automatically use this logo in the navbar and landing page. If the image is not found, a fallback SVG version will be displayed.
