          </h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 mb-4">
            A warehouse hired a lead who claimed four years at a major distributor. After onboarding, attendance and safety incidents emerged. A later check revealed limited actual overlap at the facilities listed, low review volume from real peers, and sentiment signals that pointed to reliability concerns. A rehire flag from a prior employer was never surfaced. WorkVouch would have revealed limited overlap, low review volume, sentiment signals, and the rehire flag before the offer—turning a costly mistake into a data-driven pass.
