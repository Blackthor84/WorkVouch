          <p className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 mb-4">
            A contractor hired a lead who claimed six years at a major GC. After onboarding, attendance and safety incidents emerged. A later check revealed limited actual overlap at the sites listed, low review volume from real peers, and sentiment signals that pointed to reliability concerns. A rehire flag from a prior employer was never surfaced. WorkVouch would have revealed limited overlap, low review volume, sentiment signals, and the rehire flag before the offer—turning a costly mistake into a data-driven pass.
