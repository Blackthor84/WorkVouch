# 🎬 WorkVouch Sandbox Demo Narration

Use this script while the Activity Monitor is open. The screen explains itself so you never have to say "trust me."

---

## 🎤 INTRO (10–15 seconds)

"What you're looking at is our Sandbox Activity Monitor. This shows—live—what the WorkVouch system is doing internally in response to actions, without touching production data."

---

## 🏗 STEP 1 — Generate a Company

(Click **Generate Company** in Playground)

"I'll start by generating a fake company. This creates a sandbox employer and several employees—just like real users, but fully isolated."

**What the feed shows:**
- Sandbox company created
- 5 sandbox employees generated

"Each event you see here is logged by the system in real time."

---

## 🧪 STEP 2 — Run a Scenario (Healthy Team)

(Click **Healthy Team**)

"Now I'll run a healthy team scenario. This simulates positive peer reviews and normal workplace behavior."

**Feed updates:**
- Scenario started: healthy_team
- Peer reviews created
- Reputation score increased

"Notice how the reputation system responds automatically—no manual rules, no scripts."

---

## ⚠️ STEP 3 — Run a Scenario (Toxic Manager)

(Click **Toxic Manager**)

"Now let's introduce a toxic manager."

**Feed updates:**
- Negative peer reviews generated
- Reputation score decreased
- Abuse signal detected

"This is the key moment. The system detects risk patterns and flags abuse signals without anyone reporting it directly."

---

## 👁 STEP 4 — Explain Safe Mode (if present)

(Point to **🧪 Simulated** badge)

"If you see this 'Simulated' badge, it means the system is running in safe mode—useful for demos or partial data. The behavior is identical to production logic."

---

## 🎭 STEP 5 — Impersonation

(Click **Impersonate** on an employee)

"Now I'll impersonate one of these employees."

**Feed updates:**
- Impersonation started

"From this point on, I'm seeing the platform exactly as that employee would—reviews, visibility, permissions—all real."

(Optional: navigate app briefly)

"This lets employers or investors experience the system from any perspective."

---

## 🧾 STEP 6 — Exit Impersonation

(Click **Exit**)

**Feed updates:**
- Impersonation ended

"Every sensitive action is tracked and visible. Nothing happens silently."

---

## 🎯 CLOSING (10 seconds)

"This monitor is the core of WorkVouch. It shows how trust, reputation, and abuse detection evolve over time—clearly, safely, and transparently."
