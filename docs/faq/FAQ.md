# PeerCV Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Comprehensive FAQ Section**

## How PeerCV Works

### Q: What is PeerCV?
**A**: PeerCV is a peer-verified career platform that helps you build a trusted work history profile using references from coworkers who actually worked with you. Employers can verify your experience instantly through our Trust Score system.

### Q: How does peer verification work?
**A**: When you add a job to your profile, PeerCV matches you with coworkers who also worked at the same company during overlapping dates. These coworkers can verify your employment and write references about your work. This creates a verified, trustworthy career profile.

### Q: What makes PeerCV different from LinkedIn?
**A**: Unlike LinkedIn, PeerCV requires actual coworker verification. You can't just list any job—coworkers must confirm you worked together. This creates a more trustworthy, verified career profile that employers can rely on.

## Coworker Matching

### Q: How are coworkers matched?
**A**: PeerCV uses an automated matching system that finds people who:
1. Worked at the same company as you
2. Had overlapping employment dates
3. Are registered on PeerCV

When you add a job, we search for potential matches and suggest them to you.

### Q: What if I can't find my coworkers on PeerCV?
**A**: You can invite coworkers by email. They'll receive an invitation to join PeerCV and verify your work. Once they join and verify, they can write references for you.

### Q: Can I request verification from someone who didn't work with me?
**A**: No. PeerCV only allows verification requests between people who worked at the same company during overlapping dates. False verification requests may result in account suspension.

### Q: What if a coworker denies my verification request?
**A**: If a coworker denies your verification, that job won't be verified. You can:
- Review the job details to ensure they're accurate
- Contact the coworker directly (if you have their contact info)
- Remove the job if it's incorrect
- Contact PeerCV support if you believe the denial was in error

## Trust Score

### Q: What is the Trust Score?
**A**: The Trust Score is a 0-100 rating that reflects how verified and trustworthy your career profile is. It's calculated based on:
- Number of verified jobs
- Number of peer references received
- Quality/rating of references
- Profile completeness

### Q: How is my Trust Score calculated?
**A**: Trust Scores are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that considers:
- **Verified Jobs**: Each verified job adds points
- **Peer References**: More references increase your score
- **Reference Quality**: Higher-rated references contribute more
- **Profile Completeness**: Complete profiles score higher

Scores are recalculated nightly to reflect new verifications and references.

### Q: How can I improve my Trust Score?
**A**: To improve your Trust Score:
1. **Add more jobs**: More verified jobs = higher score
2. **Request references**: Ask coworkers to write references
3. **Complete your profile**: Add skills, certifications, and other details
4. **Verify all jobs**: Ensure all jobs are verified by coworkers
5. **Maintain quality**: High-quality references boost your score more

### Q: What's a good Trust Score?
**A**: 
- **0-30**: Just getting started, add more verified jobs and references
- **31-60**: Good foundation, keep building
- **61-80**: Strong profile, well-verified
- **81-100**: Excellent, highly trusted profile

### Q: Can my Trust Score go down?
**A**: Yes. Your Trust Score can decrease if:
- References are removed (e.g., due to disputes)
- Jobs are unverified (e.g., if a coworker denies verification)
- Your profile becomes less complete
