# Enterprise Demo Walkthrough Script

Use for investor or customer demos (e.g. MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment).

---

## Step 1 – Enterprise Overview

**Say:** "This is your corporate dashboard. You can see all properties in one place."

**Show:**
- Total employees
- Peer validation stats (verified / with references, completion rate)
- Cross-property activity (locations count)

**Pause.**

**Say:** "Now let's drill into a single property."

---

## Step 2 – Location Drilldown

**Show:**
- Locations page: table with Location Name, HR Admins, Employee Count, Reference Count, Activity Status
- Click a location → Location detail
- Property-level employee list, resume parsing, peer feedback

**Say:** "Each property operates independently, but corporate has visibility."

---

## Step 3 – Resume Import

- Upload a sample resume (PDF or DOCX).
- **Show:** Parsed output (full_name, email, job_history, skills, certifications) in clean structured display.
- **Show:** Overlap detection and suggested peer matches (same company, overlapping dates).

**Say:** "The system automatically identifies coworkers based on overlap."

---

## Step 4 – Employee View

- Switch to impersonated employee (Super Admin → Impersonate User → Employee).
- **Show:** My Resume (parsed, editable, re-run parsing), Peer Feedback (average rating, written comments, timeline).

**Say:** "Employees see exactly what peers have said about them. Transparency = accountability."

---

## Step 5 – Cross-Location Transfer

- Open an employee who worked at two properties.
- **Show:** Combined peer feedback, timeline across locations.

**Say:** "Internal transfers become instantly verifiable."

---

## Close

**Say:** "This isn't replacing your HR system. It's adding a workforce validation layer across all properties."

All data and behavior in sandbox are real (same logic as production). No mock dashboards or fake references.
