### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**PeerCV Launches Peer-Verified Career Platform with Trust Scores**

[City, Date] - PeerCV, the first peer-verified career platform, today announced the launch of its platform that allows job seekers to build verified career profiles with coworker verification and Trust Scores.

Unlike traditional career platforms, PeerCV requires actual coworker verification for every job listed. Job seekers add their work history, and PeerCV matches them with coworkers who worked at the same company during overlapping dates. These coworkers verify employment and write references, building a Trust Score (0-100) that reflects verification completeness.

"PeerCV solves a real problem in hiring: verification," said [Founder Name], CEO of PeerCV. "Employers spend weeks and hundreds of dollars verifying candidate work history. PeerCV lets job seekers build verified profiles proactively, and employers can verify in seconds for a fraction of the cost."

Key features include:
- Peer-verified work history
- Trust Score system (0-100)
- Industry-specific fields for law enforcement, security, hospitality, and retail
- Instant employer verification
- Secure, encrypted data storage

PeerCV is available now on [App Store/Web]. Basic features are free, with Pro ($8.99/month) and Elite ($19.99/month) tiers available. Employer subscriptions start at $7.99 per lookup or $49/month for unlimited access.
